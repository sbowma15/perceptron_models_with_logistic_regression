Simple Perceptron Model Explanation
This Python program provides an in-depth explanation and implementation of a simple perceptron model. The perceptron is a fundamental concept in neural networks and serves as the building block for more complex models. The program covers both theoretical concepts and practical implementations using NumPy and PyTorch.

Objectives of this Program
The main objectives of this program are as follows:

Introduction to Logistic Regression: The program starts with a quick introduction or review of logistic regression, laying the foundation for understanding the perceptron.

Implementation of a Toy Perceptron Example: A toy example of a perceptron is implemented and experimented with. This step helps in grasping the basic structure and functioning of a perceptron.

Connection Between Perceptron and Logistic Regression: The relationship between the perceptron and logistic regression is explored. Understanding this connection is crucial for building a bridge between simpler models and more advanced neural networks.

Gradient Descent Implementation: The program demonstrates the implementation of gradient descent using both NumPy and PyTorch. Gradient descent is a key optimization algorithm used to train machine learning models.

Basic Model Implementation with PyTorch: A basic model is implemented using PyTorch, a powerful deep learning library. This step showcases the transition from manual implementations to utilizing specialized deep learning frameworks.
